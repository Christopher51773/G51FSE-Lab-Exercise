\subsection{Comments about the module}
The content is not the most interesting, but is delivered well. The group lab sessions also help to make the module more enjoyable.

The content from the guest lectures has been interesting and seems like it will be useful.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I've learned some basic LaTeX and Git skills as well as the actual processes that go into making a piece of software other than just coding. I've learned some UML diagrams and where it is appropriate to use them.
