\subsection{Comments about the module}
I can see how important the things we are learning are, but the module can get quite boring at times. It is taught well, but the actual content is not always that interesting.

This stuff on Git and LaTeX is interesting, and I hope everyone keeps using it, as it will be a lot easier than emailing around word documents.

I agree wholeheartedly with Dan on the cats issue, but I can't figure out how to put one into LaTeX without the compiler shouting lots of mean things at me.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

My selfie with Max is in Figure~\ref{fig:cats}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I've learned a lot about the process behind making actual software, rather than the small programs we've been making in other modules. I now realise how important it is to make sure you have a clear idea of exactly what to make before starting, as the earlier problems are found, the easier and cheaper they are to fix.
